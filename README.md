# Human Activity Recognition

We evaluate many different machine learning algorithms and approaches on human activity recognition (HAR) task.
The report of our research is contained in the *report* folder.

Algorithms we evaluate:

- KNN
- LSTM and different window sizes
- LightGBM
- Multy Layer Perceptron
- Support Vector Machine
